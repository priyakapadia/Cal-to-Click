Our APP is called Click2Cal. 
Click2Cal can take a picture an event on a poster or a flyer and directly add to the user's calendar without them having to input the date, time and the location.

The app is made on Andriod Studio; the image to text conversion is done using Haven and the data parsing is done using Regular Expressions.
