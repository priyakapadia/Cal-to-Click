Please see wiki.

The name of our app is Click2Cal (C2C).
This app allows the user to take a picture of a poster, flyer, or banner of an event. After image processing, the corresponding date, time and location of the event is added to their calendar. The app allows the user to edit the event details to add any notes or extra information, and save the picture in the event details as a reference.

Our app uses Haven's API for the OCR and later it uses Regular Expressions (RegEx) to parse the data output.

This app is made by Sneha Pradhan, Priya Kapadia, Jay Angel, Wonjae Yang and Kiara Alberto.
